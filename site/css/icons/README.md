# Icon Files
The icons directory contains font files needed for StoryMapJs to work correctly.

## Icon font
`tl-icons.eot` and `tl-icons.ttf` are font files that TimelineJs uses to display arrows and media icons on the map. These files are referenced by the timeline css file with the paths `icons/tl-icons.eot` and `icons/tl-icons.ttf`.

In order for TimelineJs to be able to find them and work correctly, the timeline css file must be in the css directory and the icons font files must be in the css/icons directory.
